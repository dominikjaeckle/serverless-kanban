This repository contains my Udacity Cloud Developler capstone project. In the following I will give you some information and remarks on setting up the project. 

### client-app

![client-app](images/client-app.png)

The client app (/client-app) is written in angular and uses the angular material ui framework. The authentication is done via Auth0 and you can login using e.g. your gmail account. 

#### setting up the client-app

- Auth0: in case you are using your own Auth0 authentication, please adapt the **domain:** and **clientId** variables in the file client-app/src/assets/config/auth-config.json
